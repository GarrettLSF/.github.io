                <p class="subtitle anim-fade-in-up" data-delay="100">Elite Install was born from a simple but powerful idea: furniture dealers deserve an installation partner who is as committed to their success as they are. We are not just a crew for hire; we are a strategic partner founded to solve the exact problems we faced in our own careers.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="story-content anim-fade-in-up">
                    <p>Before founding Elite Install, our leader spent years as a senior project manager for educational and commercial furniture dealerships.</p>
                    <p>He lived the daily struggle you know all too well: the missed deadlines from unreliable subs, the budget overruns from inefficiency, and the constant brand damage caused by unprofessional crews on-site. The stress of managing installations often overshadowed the satisfaction of a completed project.</p>
                    <p class="highlight-text">He knew there had to be a better way. A partnership built on transparency, accountability, and a deep respect for the dealer's reputation.</p>
                    <p>So, he built it.</p>
                    <p>Elite Install was meticulously designed to be the installation company he always wished he could hire. Our entire process is filtered through the lens of a project manager. We anticipate challenges, communicate proactively, and treat every single project with the urgency and professionalism it deserves.</p>
