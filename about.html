                <h1>Built From Experience. Designed For You.</h1>
                <p>Elite Install was born from a simple but powerful idea: furniture dealers and project managers deserve an installation partner who is as committed to their success as they are. We are not simply a crew for hire; we are a strategic partner founded to solve the exact problems we faced during our own careers in the industry.</p>

                    <h2>From Project Manager to Your Most Trusted Partner</h2>
                </div>
                <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Before founding Elite Install, our leader spent over two decades as a senior project manager for educational and commercial furniture dealerships.</p>
                <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 1rem;">He lived the daily struggle you know all too well: the missed deadlines from unreliable subs, the budget overruns from inefficiency, and the constant brand damage caused by unprofessional crews on-site. The stress of managing installations often overshadowed the satisfaction of a completed project.</p>
                <p style="color: var(--text-primary); font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">He knew there had to be a better way. A partnership built on transparency, accountability, and a deep respect for the dealer's reputation.</p>
                <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); font-size: 1.1rem;">So, he built it.</p>
                <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Elite Install was meticulously designed to be the installation company he always wished he could hire. Our entire process is filtered through the lens of a project manager. We anticipate challenges, communicate proactively, and treat every single project with the urgency and professionalism it deserves.</p>
